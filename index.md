## Concept
Talking Robotics is a series of virtual seminars that aim to promote reflections and dialogues about Robotics and its interaction with adjacent fields. Talking Robotics happens virtually and bi-weekly, i.e., every other week, allocating 30 min for presentation and 30 min for Q&A and networking. Sessions have a roundtable format where everyone is welcome to share ideas. Recordings and materials are shared in this website.
