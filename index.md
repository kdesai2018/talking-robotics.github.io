# Organization
Organized by Silvia Tulli, Patrícia Alves Oliveira, Miguel Vasco, Joana Campos


## Format
The sessions are once every two weeks and are in the form of round-table discussions where everyone is encouraged to contribute and share ideas. The discussion will be guided and moderated by us, to facilitate the flow of ideas and ensure we get somewhere by the end of each session. Readings and meeting minutes will be posted online for your reference or in case you have to miss one of the sessions.
