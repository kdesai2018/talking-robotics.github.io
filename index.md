## Concept
Talking Robotics is a series of virtual seminars about Robotics and its interaction with other relevant fields, such as Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Design Research, Human-Robot Interaction, among others. We aim to promote reflections, dialogues, and a place to network.

---

## Format
Talking Robotics happens virtually and bi-weekly, i.e., every other week, allocating 30 min for presentation and 30 min for Q&A and networking. Sessions have a roundtable format where everyone is welcome to share ideas. Recordings and materials are shared in this website.

Security issues: Zoom links are publicly available on our communication channels; thus, we kindly ask participants to rename themself - e.g., First Name + Last Name (Affiliation/Country) - when joining the session. We welcome suggestions on how to improve the security of these meetings.
