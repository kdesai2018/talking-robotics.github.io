## Speakers

Abhishek Gupta is a postdoctoral fellow at MIT, working with Pulkit Agrawal and Russ Tedrake. He completed his PhD at UC Berkeley working with Pieter Abbeel and Sergey Levine, building systems that can leverage reinforcement learning algorithms to solve robotics problems. He will start as an assistant professor at the University of Washington in Fall 2022. He is interested in research directions that enable directly performing reinforcement learning directly in the real world â€” reward supervision in reinforcement learning, large scale real world data collection, learning from demonstrations, and multi-task reinforcement learning. He has also spent time at Google Brain. He is a recipient of the NDSEG and NSF graduate research fellowships, and several of his works have been presented as spotlight presentations at top-tier machine learning and robotics conferences.
