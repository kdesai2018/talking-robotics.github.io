#### Speaker
Anastasia K. Ostrowski is a PhD student and design researcher at the MIT Media Lab in the Personal Robots Group. Her work focuses on equitable design of robots, including co-design and participatory design approaches. Before becoming a design researcher at the Media Lab, she received her master’s and bachelor degrees in biomedical engineering from the University of Michigan with a focus on engineering design processes and idea generation.

#### Abstract

We'll talk about methods to learn humans' reward functions from natural language input. While robotics has historically focused on learning from natural language instructions, we find that humans prefer to teach with rich evaluative and descriptive feedback. To learn from this naturalistic language, we develop a new sentiment-analysis based approach: we decompose feedback into sentiment about the features of a Markov decision process. We then perform an analogue of Bayesian inverse reinforcement learning, regressing the sentiment on the features to infer the teacher's latent reward function. Behavioral experiments validate that this agent successfully recovers humans' reward functions from natural language input. Finally, we'll cover more recent theoretical work that seeks to explain how a rational speaker should use these different forms of language.
