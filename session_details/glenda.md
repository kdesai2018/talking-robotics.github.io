## Abstract
The topic of trust in human-robot interaction is considered important for a successful uptake of
advanced robotic systems in human everyday life and society. In this talk, I will present my research on the nature of trust in HRI, which is motivated by my disciplinary background in philosophy. In the first part of my talk I will present some theoretical considerations to re-frame the current discussion on trust in HRI. Specifically, I will account for the conceptualizations of trust in HRI and explain why they are problematic for the specific case of agent-like robotic systems. This is because the conceptualization of trust as reliance is too weak while trust as interpersonal is too strong. I will suggest an emphasis on vulnerability as the precondition of trust as a way to avoid this conceptual challenge. To conclude the theoretical part I will reflect on how this strategy translates into empirical work. In the second part of my talk, I will present the results of two empirical studies that aimed to explore the different aspects of vulnerability during trust in HRI from both a robot-centered and human-centered perspective. When discussing how these studies contribute to current work on trust in HRI, I will also address some of the methodological issues often raised as major challenges. To end this talk, I will shortly discuss some broader reflections about studying trust in HRI that I have not been able to include but are still highly relevant.
