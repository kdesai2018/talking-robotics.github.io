#### Speaker
Anastasia K. Ostrowski is a PhD student and design researcher at the MIT Media Lab in the Personal Robots Group. Her work focuses on equitable design of robots, including co-design and participatory design approaches. Before becoming a design researcher at the Media Lab, she received her master’s and bachelor degrees in biomedical engineering from the University of Michigan with a focus on engineering design processes and idea generation.

#### Abstract

As robots enter our social spaces, we are faced with new complex questions and challenges, such as how these technologies will create or further entrench inequities in society and whose voices are heard in technology design. To help address these challenges, human-centered design methodologies and frameworks, such as participatory design, co-design, and Design Justice, can be further developed in human-robot interaction to promote more equitable robot design and policy design processes. In this talk, I will discuss my work on empowering users through co-design of robots, presenting design guidelines for more equitable co-design practices in human-robot interaction and promoting further discussion around the design ecosystems of innovative technology.
