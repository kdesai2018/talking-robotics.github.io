#### Abstract

The talk will look back over the recent history of robotics, at what we have achieved as a field, and what still needs to be done.  Peter Corke will argue that we are stuck, seemingly unable to pull together what we know into systems that will impress and delight and generate wealth.  He will speculate about some of the causes, and suggest some future directions (that come to us from the past).
